## Hi, I'm Rikan Saha! üëã
<p align="justify"> 
  Assistant Manager with 2+ years of dedicated experience in Model Risk Management and Governance within the Banking and Financial Services (BFS) sector.

Highly fascinated by the Data & Advanced Analytics domain, particularly Machine Learning and Data Science, I possess proven expertise in Data Analysis, Risk Management, Model Risk Operations and Automation. My technical toolkit includes Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, complemented by a solid foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms. I have a track record of developing practical solutions, including building impactful Streamlit applications and various Python-based automation tools/scripts that have directly contributed to improved process efficiency, enhanced reporting capabilities, and the delivery of effective solutions. I am driven by continually applying and learning analytical and programming skills to deliver valuable, data-driven outcomes.

### College Projects
<p align "Justify">
  
#### Brain Tumour Image Segmentation using Deep Learning
- Conducted a comprehensive analysis of Deep Learning models for Brain Tumor Segmentation from MRI scans, comparing architectures like U-Net, FCNs, and CNNs to assist radiologists in detection and treatment planning.
- Implemented models from scratch using Python and frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras, evaluating performance with metrics such as Dice Score Coefficient, Accuracy, Intersection over Union.

#### Target Coverage & Connectivity in Wireless Sensor Network
- Built a Java Applet to simulate and solve the Target Coverage and Connectivity problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), determining the minimum number of sensors needed for target coverage and connectivity to base stations.
- Integrated the GNU Linear Programming Kit (GLPK) solver for coverage optimization and employed f-factor approximation and the Steiner Tree Algorithm for efficient communication topology.

#### Market Basket Analysis
- Built a Java Applet for Market Basket Analysis, identifying frequent item-sets and association rules in transaction data using the Apriori algorithm to extract insights into product associations.
- The tool analyses customer purchase behaviour, generating rules like "customers who buy item A are likely to buy item B," supporting marketing and sales decision-making.
